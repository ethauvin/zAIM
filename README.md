Access the AOL Quick Buddy (AIM) applet directly on your Zaurus.

The Jeode applet viewer is used to automatically open and configure the applet.

The package is really small as the applet is actually accessed over the Internet. The applet windows and dialogs are pre-configured for the Zaurus screen size (whenever possible).
